		<p id="interesting_facts">They’re symbols of monarchy, bravery, regality and any number of other positive qualities, and there are depictions of lions in popular culture reaching all the way back into prehistory.
			Once a kill has been dragged back to the pride, the male lions feed first – and lionesses often have to snarl or fight for their share.

			<!-- your favorite animal's list items go here -->
			<li ><span>Feeding</span>: They kill mostly large, herbivorous mammals – wildebeest, impala, zebra, buffalo, warthog, boar, gazelle and springbok.They are capable of taking down a fully grown male giraffe, but only do so in dire circumstances – giraffes are surprisingly fierce, and attacking one runs a high risk of injury to the lioness. The same goes for hippopotamus, rhinoceros and elephant – each is possible if needs absolutely must, but this is a dangerous hunt and to be attempted only when there is no other choice.</li>
			<li><span>Reproduction</span>: Lionesses can come into heat at any time of year, and while she is in such a state – which usually persists for two or three days – she will mate thirty to forty times a day with the males in her pride. This is a point of competition for male lions, however; they will often fight for the privilege of mating with a lioness in heat first or exclusively.
			<li><span>Lioness and Cub</span>: Females give birth 3.5 months after conception and give birth up to 4 cubs at a time although litters of 2 or 3 are more common. Often the first sign that a lioness has given birth are large stains around her nipples. Mothers of young cubs spend most of their time away from the pride, although they may join their companions for brief periods. Cubs are usually hidden in dense bush for approximately six weeks, when they are old enough to join the pride. During the six weeks the cubs rely entirely on their mother looking after them and feeding on their mothers milk.</li>
			<li><span>Play</span>: Females remain playful when they are adults as males do not. Cubs play with anything that arouses their interest including ostrich eggs, turtles and their mothers tail. They sometimes try to play with adults but mostly play with each other. Most of their play imitates behaviors they will use as adults including stalking and fighting. Play is an important way for cubs to learn these adult skills as well as to form strong social bonds with their companions.</li>

		<p>Lionesses are, by nature, more aggressive than male lions. As such, they hunt in groups to feed the entire pride – leaving the males to stay at care the young. Generally speaking, they co-ordinate to surround their prey and stalk them for a while before sprinting in a short burst, killing them by strangulation, and sharing the load on the journey back to the group where all the lions eat.</p>
